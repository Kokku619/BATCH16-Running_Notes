Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. 

It allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure (like servers, databases, networks, etc.) using declarative configuration files, usually written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON.

- setup and maintenance of infrastructure across many cloud providers 

  - Automation: No need to manually configure infrastructure.

  - Version Control: Code can be stored in Git like app code.

  - Repeatable: Run the same config in different environments.

  - Multi-Cloud: Works across different cloud providers.
  
  
 =======================
Core Architecture Components
Terraform Core (CLI)

      Written in Go.      
      Parses HCL configuration files.      


Providers:
       Plugins that allow Terraform to interact with APIs (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes).
       
       Define the types of resources available for management.
       
State File (terraform.tfstate)
       
       JSON file that stores metadata of managed resources.       

       Used to track current infrastructure state.       

       Can be stored locally or remotely (e.g. S3, Azure Blob).      

       Ensures consistency and supports collaboration (with locking).


 ==========

 Terraform Workflow
 
Write:Create configuration in .tf files.


terraform init: Run terraform init to initialize the working directory and download providers.

terraform  Plan: Run terraform plan to preview changes.

terraform  Apply: Run terraform apply to provision/update resources.

terraform  Destroy : Run terraform destroy to tear down infrastructure.
