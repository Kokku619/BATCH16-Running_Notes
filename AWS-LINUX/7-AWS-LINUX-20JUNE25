init --> parent of all process with pid 1 

    init is the very first process to run when a Linux system boots. It's responsible for starting other processes and services that are necessary for the system to function.
	
    Controlling Runlevels: init plays a crucial role in managing runlevels, which define the state of the system and the services that are running.
	
-------------------------
runlevels :

In Linux, run levels represent different operating states or modes of the system. 

run levels were used to define the state of the system during system initialization or shutdown

init 0 
Run Level 0: System Halt/Shut down
          Terminates all processes and shuts down the system gracefully.

init 1 		
Run Level 1: Single-user mode { used for recovery} 
          Only a single user can work on the system, typically used for system maintenance tasks.
init 2		  
Run Level 2: Multi-user mode without networking (with out NFS) 
          Multiple users can work on the system simultaneously, but networking services are not started.
		  
Run Level 3: Multi-user mode with networking ( USED MOSTLY FOR SERVER ) 
           Multiple users can work on the system simultaneously, and networking services (such as TCP/IP networking) are started.
		   
Run Level 4: Undefined (often not used).
           Historically, some distributions used run level 4 for special purposes, but it's generally not standardized and remains unused in many setups.
		   
Run Level 5: Graphical mode.
           Starts the system into a full graphical environment, typically with a display manager like GDM or LightDM.
		   
Run Level 6: Reboot.
          Reboots the system, shutting down all processes and restarting the system.

init 6 
------------------
to change run levels use init command 

init 0 
init 6
